<h1>HERE, I HAVE CREATED A JAVAFX APPLICATION USING APIs that will provide data about the Luminous Spheroid OF PLASMA that is held together by gravity basically known as Star. </h1>

<h2>Here, at the Home page user can see the data of some of the popular and common stars present in The Kepler Star System and after pressing button for "Click To search", user will move to a new GUI Interface where user can search any star that have been discovered and have information in the database of NASA.</h2>

<h3>Basically, user can search any star and in return , the application and APIs will display the following parameters:
  <li>Name of the Star</li>
  <li>Apparent Magnitude</li>
  <li>Absolute Magnitude</li>
  <li>Distance in Light Years from Earth</li>
  <li>Spectaral Class (Because Stars are bascially defined in 7 classes in Astrophysics)</li>
</h3>
